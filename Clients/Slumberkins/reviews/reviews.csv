Being a parent is hard. There is no feeling worse than watching your child struggle. I was so grateful to find this book and lovable huggable friends. Anxiety and worry are a hard problem for adults, let alone children. The book lays out how to acknowledge your worries so they don't consume you and that Alpaca can carry your burdens. It reminds us that we are never alone which is so¬†paramount when dealing with anxiety. I normally always keep an extra alpaca for when a little one in my life is having a hard time. When there are medical issues or big life changes, Alpaca is perfect to help carry the burden of that worry.

I also love how it instills at a young age that we can reach out and share our worries. Many adults do not know how to talk about difficult things that are scary. Studies show that those who can be open and honest in their feelings are normally happier individuals. Raising happy, emotionally intelligent kids, I think, is the goal for most parents and Alpaca definitely helps!",,2020-01-16 01:34:11 UTC,

Stress and anxiety are an increasing concern in our worlds and the sooner we can instill these positive affirmations in our children the better equipped they are with their emotions and feelings. The book captures how stress and anxiety may feel to a child and gives them the tools to deal with the emotions. My favorite part is the end of the book when the child repeats the positive affirmation. The more we repeat these affirmations to ourselves, it becomes second nature.

stress-relief-snuggler-bundle,published,5,More Than a ‚ÄúStuffie‚Äù,Holly,mrsmommy13@gmail.com,"","My son has always been an amazing little boy with big, sometimes overwhelming, emotions. We‚Äôve used many techniques to help him over the years, but when he was diagnosed with a chronic illness 2 years ago, his worry and anxiety reached new heights. (As did the entire family‚Äôs, if we‚Äôre being honest.) Finding Slumberkins has meant so much more to our family than just finding a beautifully made plush toy for our children. Slumberkins has given us another tool in our belt to help all of our children deal with big, adult sized stress in a way that makes them feel loved, supported, and safe, while instilling in them the confidence that they will get through it and are never alone. As a parent you want to be able to take all those big worries and fears away, and having something like Alpaca, who helps my child not be as anxious or scared, is simply amazing. Thank you for what you do. It matters. ",,2020-01-17 10:00:27 UTC,

stress-relief-snuggler-bundle,published,5,Mommas need stress relief too!,Victoria ,salasmickey14@gmail.com,"","I absolutely love Alpaca! From the softest feel, loving face, to the thoughtfully curated book. The illustrations on each and every book are breathtaking and even the feel of the books are a soft nice material. To teach children at such a tender age that stress happened but we need others to count on or even to ask for help is truly a great message. It‚Äôs great that children grow up knowing they don‚Äôt have to be alone at stressful times is not only beneficial to child but to mom as well. As a mother sometimes I forget that I too can ask for help. We want to do it all and forget to ask for help when we feel overwhelmed. A book that can not only connect to child but to adults as well is an amazing thing that I was not expecting when purchasing this cutie. If you‚Äôre contemplating getting the sweetest stress reliever DON‚ÄôT! Get you this cutie in your cart and worry about telling you SO later! My husband even loves Alfie (our alpaca). Oh and don‚Äôt get my started on my daughter. She will not go anywhere without her pal. ",,2020-01-17 15:34:26 UTC,

They are more than books and a soft comfort item to help your child fall a sleep. They are an invitation to an experience. My daughter has severe, aggressive autism. Life isn't easy with her and we have tried so many ways with numerous professionals to find something to help. Shortly before finding Slumberkins, we were told she was a danger to society. She's six. My heart broke. That night, with a bit of wine on board, I made some purchases...the sum of money didn't matter because what was coming was an opportunity to get into her world, to connect, to find her beauty inside. Since then we have introduced them to her teachers, sending the cards to school so she can point to feelings if she cannot identify them herself. I have become obsessed, yesterday she cuddled watching Slumberschool something she has always struggled with. Thank you for letting me live the mom life I missed with this child and reminding me professionals may have a thought as to who your child is but with work, effort and love perhaps you can prove them wrong.

honey-bear-board-book,published,5,One night of reading this book and my 3 1/2 year old opened up,Jessica,wildflowerbeautybyjessica@gmail.com,"","We have a very demanding 3 1/2 year old who literally says to us ""it's not enough I want more"" when it comes to MANY things... toys especially.  This wasn't on our first list of books we wanted to order, but we decided to add it in and it has turned out to be our favorite - maybe because of her age. After the first night, she said she knew how much I loved her because I always make her special foods that keep her safe (she has a very long allergy list of foods).  I love how the books pop little questions in there that you can ask to have your child interject an opinion.  She feels involved, and with all 5 of the books we ordered, is really enjoying them.  She also gravitates to them to read them to her dolls. 
I really do wish the free downloads were not the same story line though.  I was a little taken back that I had already downloaded the stories while waiting for my books to come, just without pictures.  Definitely important to have the physical book, but it does feel like the value is taken by giving the same story for free to everyone without purchase.

It had spots where it was missing it‚Äôs fur hair, specifically on the tail making it not as soft as usual. And in between the eyes, the hair was going in all directions making it almost seem used or damaged the day I received. Maybe it was just the one I got but I still haven‚Äôt taken it out of the box again to know my kiddo because I am truly disappointed in the quality.

I really wanted my son who is 18 month old to love it more than he did but unfortunately he really loves the tags because they were soaked but they were square and short he likes long silk tags just his preference though. So that he did kind of like but I think it was just too small for him. He has another lovey similar to this but a different brand and the head is 3D fully staffed and it's just a little bigger. I think if they made these in a bigger size they would be perfect but they're just too small. There's no way to it there's nothing to it. I gave him a kin and he seemed to take to that a little better because of it being sicker and more full. So I really wish they would just make bigger sizes but all in all super soft super cute just wasn't for my son.

They go down the slides and hug each other and get upset with her when she's having a hard time. WereFox (Woo) helped tremendously with her fear of dogs and is her current favorite.

Not only that, but the Fox story is amazing for autistic kiddos. Change is particularly hard for us so having reassurance and a sensory safe pal is a huge help for my little one.

(The Island of Misfit Toys from Rudolph for sure made me cry when I was young!)  The one I received had a bit of of a crooked stich in his tail, but it's really not too noticeable, and I love him anyway.    I really like the flat body of the snuggler - if you roll them up, them are the perfect size to fit into the kangaroo pocket of my hoodie, and that means I can take my Lynx wherever I want any nobody has to know.

While he loves his day at school, every morning at drop off he is sobbing and begging me for another hug. The morning anxiety surrounding school has left our house with a dread every day. I saw an ad for these snugglies on social media and bought one on a whim, grasping at straws for something. The Alpaca arrived literally in two days which was unreal. We played up the theatrics to our son about receiving a special support gift from ‚Äúthe earth spirits‚Äù (his words). Really leaned into his imagination while introducing the story and affirmations. I was worried he was going to think it was silly, but he clung to it instantly. It felt like something he was needing finally got released. That night he slept with his alpaca. The next morning we got ready, left for school- alpaca in hand (gave his teacher a heads up- she knows we have been struggling). When we got to school he became overwhelmed as usual which is when we recited the affirmations. By the second time through, he hugged me, grabbed his alpaca right and walked into school SMILING!! Not a tear. After MONTHS of morning breakdowns. I cannot thank enough. Even if it‚Äôs for one day, I would still give 5 stars. What a relief from the heartache. Love this brand. Love this story.

The skills taught in this course give students a good understanding of the tools to deal with a variety of situations. I just wish I had found Slumberkins sooner.

I love that it goes deeper beyond ‚Äúuse your words‚Äù for conflict resolution but to understanding how to calm down first when angry. The children have really connected to the characters and stories and I have gotten so many positive responses from parents. It‚Äôs been amazing to have three years talking about ‚Äúpositive self-talk,‚Äù growth mindset,‚Äù ‚Äúemotional courage‚Äù and more.
