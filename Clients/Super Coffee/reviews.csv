I love the product but your delivery leaves a lot to be desired. The last two packages delivered to my house have had creamer. When delivered the creamer is leaking all over my porch and unusable.,4721423056947,Plant-Based Power-Up,Love the product,Bonnie H.,true,0

"I love Super Coffee&#x27;s Cold Brew Bold and Smooth. I have tried it with their Sweet Sweet Creamer and recently their Pumpkin Creamer. It&#x27;s the best Cold Brew I have had. I love the smooth but bold flavor. I add ice to my cup, pour the cold brew over the ice. Then I add the creamer and mix it in. I find if you let it sit for a few minutes and them stir. The flavor is so rich. I definitely highly recommend it!",4721424826419,Iced Perfecta,The Best Cold Brew Ever!,Shannon S.,true,0

"Super Coffee has to be the best flavored, energy packed coffee on the market. I used to have a Starbucks with espresso problem, and a daily Cafe Bustello/espresso coffee. But all are so heavy! Super Coffee is the best of all things COFFEE with a punch. Tastes amazing, energy boosts without jitters, and light on the stomach so you don&#x27;t feel overly full and weighed down. I could go on and ON!!! I&#x27;m so glad I found Super Coffee and have shared with all of my special diet friends from Gluten-free to Vegan and they are also impressed!!!!",4721377116211,Coffee Hall of Fame,New coffee addiction,Deanna W.,true,2
"Blueberry Latte caused me to lose sleep last night, not because I drank it too late in the day yesterday but because I was so excited to try it this morning. Wow! Blueberry Latte exceeded my expectations. With the sharp crack of the plastic as I twisted open the cap my mouth started to water. As I peeled off the aluminum seal of freshness my nose detected a faint smell of blueberries in the air and my excitement elevated. I lifted the bottle to my lips and the smooth and creamy coffee poured into my mouth coating my tastebuds with a sweet nectar they had never tasted before but immediately knew they couldn’t get enough. The taste profile of the blueberry latte is perfectly balanced between coffee and blueberry that is strong enough to enjoy but is in no was too much. It blows my mind that this flavor profile is created with ZERO sugar! It’s the perfect drink.",6542291796019,Blueberry Muffin Super Coffee,Blue my mind berry,Kevin S.,true,66
The most refreshing bottled coffee ever. It’s perfect for summer. I’m FEELING IT. Thank you Super Fam!,6542291796019,Blueberry Muffin Super Coffee,Beyond incredible!!,Ben K.,true,20
I love the Blueberry Latte but won&#x27;t be ordering again. I feel they charge too much money. I can buy super coffee in my local grocery store for 2.00 each when on sale. Also when I ordered the blueberry an offer showed up for super creamer for 7.99. Knowing they sell the creamer in a 3 pack I was under the impression I was getting a 3-pack for a special price. Who in their right mind would pay 7.99 for a container of cream? Apparently me the idiot. I can buy the creamer in my local grocery store for under 4.00. So I will now only buy these products on sale at my local store. Thanks for showing loyalty doesn&#x27;t really matter. I also emailed them about this and got no response and left a comment on an instagram post. No one reached out proves they don&#x27;t care. Save your money buy local.,6542291796019,Blueberry Muffin Super Coffee,Blueberry Latte,Elizabeth S.,true,8

"I’m actually here at work drinking your coffee right now as we speak. The flavor is good. It gives me energy. I love the hazelnut creamer, you don’t need to add any more sugar on the coffee for me it’s a light sweet that you need instead of pouring tons of sugar in it. You don’t need it.",4670729879603,Dark Roast Super Pods,I’m actually here at work,Nelson G.,true,1

"I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to try it before buying more. I like strong coffee, but this is way too strong for me. Also, I don&#x27;t like the sweetener being used. It leaves a weird aftertaste. The only way I can drink it is to dilute it with milk, so it won&#x27;t go to waste.",1406083694643,Super Coffee Variety Pack,Too Strong / too sweet,Ellen G.,true,38

Absolutely a game changer if you are on a low carb diet. I began Keto and was discouraged with choices of creamers. I am a huge coffee drinker and was wasting carbs.

"I searched and searched for acceptable creamers when I started keto. All fell flat...powders, almond, coconut, you name it I tried it. These saved my love of (coffee) and creamer!!

Love this so much I take it with me when I travel!",4447811764275,Sweet Cream Super Creamer,Travels with me!!,Pam,true,5
"Flavor and energy receive a 5 star rating. No matter how much I shake the drink before and during drinking, I can’t get some chunks to go away that either settle at the bottom or around the cap at the top. It just makes the last sip really chunky. I think it’s the protein though so I drink it up. Don’t want to waste any of the benefits of drinking these!",4534979297331,Caramel Latte Super Coffee,Delicious flavor but chunky,Sara D.,true,47
